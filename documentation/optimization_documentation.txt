Process Description:
-------------------
1. **Parameter Initialization**: The initial parameters were randomly initialized.
2. **Optimization**: The optimization process was performed using a gradient descent optimizer.
3. **Parallel Processing**: The optimization and analysis were done in parallel to improve performance.
4. **Analysis**: The results were analyzed using various statistical metrics and visualizations.
5. **Hyperparameter Search**: A random search was conducted to find the best hyperparameters.

Conclusion:
-----------
The optimization process was successful, and the best hyperparameters were identified. Future work can involve further experimentation with different parameter settings or extending the analysis with additional metrics and visualizations.
